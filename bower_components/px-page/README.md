Read the full API and view the demo [here](https://predixdev.github.io/Px-Page).

The documentation in this repository is supplemental to the official Predix documentation, which is continuously updated and maintained by the Predix documentation team. Go to [http://predix.io](http://predix.io)  to see the official Predix documentation.


## Local Development

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt sass
```

From the component's directory, to start a local server run:

```
$ grunt depserve
```

Navigate to the root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) in a browser to open the API documentation page, with link to the "Demo" / working examples.


### DevMode
Devmode runs `grunt depserve` and `grunt watch` concurrently so that when you make a change to your source files and save them, your preview will be updated in any browsers you have opened and turned on LiveReload.
From the component's directory run:

```
$ grunt devmode
```
