#Px-Simple-Bar-Chart

## Overview

Px-Simple-Bar-Chart is a Predix UI component.

Use this component to visualize a series or multiple series of numeric values as a bar chart or stacked bar chart. Each series is represented by a sequence of horizontally aligned rectangle bars, the height of each proportionally representing a value. If multiple series are passed to the component then a stacked sequence of rectangle bars will be drawn using a different color to represent each series and a legend to identify them will be drawn above the bars.

The bar colors and legend labels are configurable. The width and height of the component are also configurable. We recommend viewing the demo.html page to become aware of the configuration possibilities. We also recommend using the default settings as they are designed for proper performance.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. node.js
2. npm
3. bower
4. [webcomponents-lite.js polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs)

Node, npm and bower are necessary to install the component and dependencies. webcomponents.js adds support for web components and custom elements to your application.

### Getting Started

First, install the component via bower on the command line.

```
bower install px-simple-bar-chart --save
```

Second, import the component to your application with the following tag in your head.

```
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/px-simple-bar-chart/px-simple-bar-chart.html"/>
```

Finally, use the component in your application:

```
<px-simple-bar-chart chart-data="[ [1,2,3] ]">
</px-simple-bar-chart>

<px-simple-bar-chart chart-data="[ [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3] ]">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```

## documentation

Due to a bug in auto-documenting Attributes specified in Behaviors, we are listing the following attributes here, and will move them into the auto documentation API when the bug is fixed:

### Attributes

#### width

Define the target pixel width  of the chart component. The default settings are 283.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    ...
    width="370">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```
#### height

Define the target pixel height of the chart component. The default settings are 150.

```html
<px-simple-bar-chart
    ...
    height="230">
</px-simple-bar-chart>
```

Read the full API and view the demo [here](https://predixdev.github.io/px-simple-bar-chart/).

## Local Development

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt sass
```

From the component's directory, to start a local server run:

```
$ grunt depserve
```

Navigate to the root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) in a browser to open the API documentation page, with link to the "Demo" / working examples.

### DevMode
Devmode runs `grunt depserve` and `grunt watch` concurrently so that when you make a change to your source files and save them, your preview will be updated in any browsers you have opened and turned on LiveReload.
From the component's directory run:

```
$ grunt devmode
```
