**Date**: December 8, 2015

### Overview

**Px-Simple-Horizontal-Bar-Chart** is a Predix Experience ('Px') user interface component.

Use this component to visualize a series of numeric values as a horizontally-oriented bar chart. The series is represented by horizontally left-aligned rectangle bars, the width of each proportionally representing a value.

The bar colors and legend labels are configurable. The width and height of the component are also configurable. We recommend using the default settings as they are designed for proper performance.

### Purpose

This component is meant to be used in Predix applications to visualize numeric values for users monitoring industrial data. These numeric values could represent very important information such as the internal temperatures of a gas turbine.
